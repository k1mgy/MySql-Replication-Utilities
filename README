MySql-Replication-Utilities
27 MARCH 2012

This is a collection (of one) utilities which assist in the care and feeding of MySql replication.


re-sync_replication.php
	This is a php script that is run at the commandline:
		php -f ./re-sync_replication.php
	It expects a companion configuration file: replication.cfg to exist. This file must be loaded with entries that define the host replication server and the client.
	
	re-sync_replication.php:
		- connects to the replication host
		- gathers information about the status of the host
		- connects to the replication client
		- gathers information about the status of the client
	If there is no host and/or no replication client, the script dumps with a message.  Similarly it will dump if it fails to connect, etc.

	If replication working and there is no error, the script displays all the information and exits.

	If there is a replication error, the script
		- issues "flush tables with read lock" on the host
		- issues "stop slave" on the slave
		- issues a new "change master..." command on the client
		- starts the client
		- issues "unlock tables" on the host

	After a replication error, run the script again to see if either the error persists or a new one has occurred.

	Correct each error until the script runs without showing an error.
